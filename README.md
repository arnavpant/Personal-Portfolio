## Personal Portfolio

Just a portfolio I wanted to make to show off my FrontEnd skills with HTTP, CSS and JS.

## Live Demo

The link on the left handside of the project will direct you to my website but you can also click the link below.

## Features

- I have a particle effect in the background I created that is individually added to every file.
- Shuffling text at the home screen which I thought was a unique animation to add to my website.
- Responsive Design for mobile and Desktop
- Cursor effect for a unique mouse trail
