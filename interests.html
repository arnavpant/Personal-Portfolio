          <h2>Arsenal Football Club</h2>
          <p>
            I've been an Arsenal fan since 2017, when my high school friends got me on board. Supporting the club has been a rollercoaster, but thereâ€™s nothing quite like the excitement of watching them play. 
            My favorite moment was the legendary **5-1 victory in 2025**, where we absolutely demolished them! 
            My favorite player is **Bukayo Saka**, our starboy, who represents everything great about Arsenal. I follow the club across social media and never miss a match, whether itâ€™s at home or on the road. 
            Gunners for life! ðŸ”´âšª

          <h2>Playing Football</h2>
          <p>
            While I donâ€™t get to play as often as Iâ€™d like, I still hit the pitch every couple of weeks. I usually play as a Center-Back (CB), leading the defense and enjoying the strategic aspect of the game. 
            I play casually, but football has always been a big part of my life. I started off as a Real Madrid fan before Arsenal won me over (though I still support and follow their matches), and since then, my love for the game has only grown. 
            Thereâ€™s something about the intensity of the sport that keeps me hooked.

          <h2>Travelling</h2>
          <p>
            I love travelling and experiencing different parts of the world. One of my favorite places I've been to is **Singapore**â€”a perfect blend of nature and modern architecture. The clean streets, futuristic skyline, 
            and incredible food scene made it an unforgettable experience. But my **dream travel destination is Japan**.
          </p>
          <p>
            Japan offers a **unique mix of tradition and cutting-edge modernity**. Whether itâ€™s the high-energy vibe of **Tokyo**, the cultural richness of **Kyoto**, or the peaceful landscapes of the **Japanese countryside**, 
            there's something for every traveler. Iâ€™d love to explore the cherry blossom season, try authentic sushi in Tsukiji, and maybe even catch a J-League football match. Travelling isnâ€™t just about sightseeing for meâ€”itâ€™s about **immersing myself in different cultures, trying new cuisines, and discovering the unknown**.
